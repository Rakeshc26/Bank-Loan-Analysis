# Bank Loan Report Project

## Introduction:

This Bank Loan Report is designed to offer a comprehensive analysis of the lending activities of the bank, tracking key loan metrics, monitoring loan performance, and assessing the overall health of the loan portfolio. By utilizing a series of detailed KPIs, graphical representations, and trend analysis, the report will help the bank make informed, data-driven decisions in its lending strategy and operations.

## Problem Statement:

In order to better monitor and assess the bank’s lending activities, we need a comprehensive report to evaluate key loan-related metrics over time. This will allow for tracking of trends, understanding loan performance, and ultimately making strategic decisions based on these insights. The key performance indicators (KPIs) for the report will include total loan applications, total funded amounts, total repayments, average interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and distinctions between good and bad loans.
